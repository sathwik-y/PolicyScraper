#### RETURN GUIDELINES

**Condition of Items**

Rugs should be rolled and wrapped around the tube to avoid damage. Use outer protective wrapping for added safety.

* Pet hair
* Dirt or grass stains
* Vacuum beater brush use
* Visible usage or damage
* Damage or stains
* Signs of wear, washing, or improper care

#### RETURN AUTHORIZATION NUMBER (RMA)

Mention the RMA number inside or outside of the package.

Return the item within 15 days of receiving your RMA.

We’ll assume you’re keeping the product if we don’t get it within 15 days of your RMA number.

#### PACKAGING AND REFUND PROCESS

We reserve the right to refuse returns that are damaged. This includes items damaged due to insufficient packaging.

Once received, items will be inspected. Upon approval:

A credit will be issued (excluding freight both ways and a 15% restocking fee).

Please allow 10-14 days for the refund to reflect in your account.

**Note:** If an item is used, soiled, or damaged in any way, we reserve the right to refuse credit.

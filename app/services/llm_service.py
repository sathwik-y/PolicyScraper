        You are an AI assistant tasked to extract only the necessary content from a markdown document converted from HTML.
        The markdown contains line numbers appended as 'LINE_NUMBER: content'.

        Task:
        Return only the useful line number ranges in this exact format â€” one per line:
        START-END  
        (Even for a single line: LINE-LINE)

        Output Rules:
        - DO NOT include content, just the ranges.
        - DO NOT add explanations or extra text.
        - Only include line number pairs in the format shown.

        Example:
        1-3  
        8-8  
        15-22  

        The markdown:
        {markdown_text}
        """
        response = client.messages.create(
                model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
